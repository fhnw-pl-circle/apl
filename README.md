# Introduction

[APL](https://aplwiki.com/) (_Array Programming Language_) is a highly concise
language, using its own symbols to express concepts in a very terse way.

# Installation

[Dyalog](https://www.dyalog.com/) APL is used, as it has very nice learning
resources. Either use [tryapl.org](https://tryapl.org/) or install
[dyalog](https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm?p=download) yourself. For
starting out, [ride](https://github.com/Dyalog/ride/releases) might be a good
idea as well.

The provided nix flake can be used to install dyalog and ride if a
[nix](https://nixos.org/download/) installation with
[flake support](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) is available (simply run
`nix develop` or use [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv)).

If not using tryapl.org or ride, figure out how to input APL glyphs, a good
starting point is
[APL Fonts and Keyboards](https://www.dyalog.com/apl-font-keyboard.htm), again
by Dyalog.
